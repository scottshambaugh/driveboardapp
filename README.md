**Notes on this fork:**

The original codebase at [nortd/driveboardapp](https://github.com/nortd/driveboardapp) is no longer maintained. Here are some of the highlights in this fork, see this thread for more details https://groups.google.com/g/lasersaur/c/n54LNN86H-c:
* Upgrade from python2 to python3
* Rastering completely rewritten: skips over large whitespace for speed, option for inverting, can select number of gray levels (set to 2-3 for dithering, max of 128)
* Bidirectional and nearest neighbor pathing algorithms for fill and rastering speedups
* Added a 'pulse' functionality for the laser (all safety interlocks still work)
* You can save material preset laser settings through the UI and easily load them back up
* The debug terminal can now be resized, scroll, and will not auto-jump back down when scrolling around
* Option to print out human-readable versions of the tx/rx serial commands
* Option for the head to auto-home when the interface is first started
* You can now jog in 1 mm increments by holding the ctrl key with the arrows
* Your current X-Y coordinates are shown on screen
* “Set Offset” now sets the offset to the current head position
* The head position is now set in relative dx, dy coordinates
* Many small bugfixes
* Tested on Windows and Linux

Outstanding issues:
* Building a Windows executable isn’t currently working
* Documentation needs to be updated
* Not tested on Mac

DriveboardApp
=============

DriveboardApp is the official app to control Driveboard-based CNC machines like the [Lasersaur](http://lasersaur.com). Its aim is to provide a simple yet powerful way to control the machine. Its primary features are:

- load svg vector files and send them to the machine
- display the status of the machine
- pausing/continuing/stopping a job
- firmware flashing

This software is written in Javascript (frontend), Python (backend) and C (firmware). The backend can either run directly on the Driveboard or on the client computer. The frontend runs in a web browser either on the same client computer or on a tablet computer.
